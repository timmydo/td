# Control protocol reference

This is the implemented **library prerequisite**, not an available endpoint.
`control` has no listener, thread, filesystem access, clock or Wayland access.
`--control-socket` is not accepted yet. Native dialogs/jobs/spelling results,
remote mutations and frame acknowledgements still require the window adapter
specified in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#test-and-control-architecture).

## Framing

One frame is a four-byte unsigned big-endian length followed by that many
payload bytes. Length excludes the header and must be 1..=1,048,576 bytes,
for requests and responses. There is no newline terminator. `frame` checks
the bound before allocating its output. `Decoder` accumulates one frame,
accepts arbitrary header/body fragmentation, and exposes its payload only
after all declared bytes arrive. A zero length is `protocol`; a length over
the ceiling is `limit`. Incomplete `finish` is `protocol`.

Any decoder refusal permanently poisons it and drops partial payload storage.
More input cannot revive it. Bytes beyond the declared body, if supplied to
that decoder, are refused rather than treated as a second request. Completion
does not prove peer EOF or that no later bytes will arrive: the future worker
must dispatch at most once per connection and close it after the response.
`finish` transfers the completed buffer; it performs no read or EOF check.
Empty input chunks make no progress. The decoder allocates at most one MiB
of payload storage, only after validating the length.
The full declared storage is allocated on header completion, before body
bytes arrive. The worker must budget each admitted connection against that
one-MiB allocation, not just against bytes received so far.

The future transport owns deadlines, connection limits, request/response
queues, socket permissions and cancellation. This library claims none of
those safeguards. Replay retains its consecutive-frame stdin/stdout runner;
the one-frame decoder is for the planned one-request-per-connection worker.

## Read-only requests

Payloads are ASCII tab-separated records. Literal control bytes other than
field-separating Tab, DEL and non-ASCII payload bytes are refused. Decimal
fields contain one or more digits only: leading zeros are accepted; signs,
spaces, exponents and overflow are refused. IDs/revisions fit `u64`; offsets
and limits additionally fit the host's `usize`. Missing/extra fields, unknown
versions and names are `protocol`. Parsing uses a bounded field iterator, not
a vector proportional to the number of Tab bytes in an untrusted payload.
Envelope validation and error-ID recovery are shared with replay, while the
two adapters retain distinct command allowlists.

In the examples below, field spaces denote literal Tab separators.

| Payload fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `1 ID state` | Snapshot the current controller. |
| `1 ID text TAB REVISION OFFSET LIMIT` | Read a scalar-aligned UTF-8 page. |

These are the only names accepted by `control::Request::parse`. In particular,
`new`, `load`, editing, file I/O, physical-input simulation and dialog answers
are refused; this parser is not a route into replay's broader command set.
`Request::response` borrows `&Controller`, so it cannot dispatch an edit or
change selection, views, history or generation.

An error response is `1 ID error CODE HEX_DIAGNOSTIC`. A recoverable request
ID is echoed even if the command name is missing or later arguments are
invalid. Failures before a valid ID is parsed use zero: frame-size, ASCII
and version checks precede ID parsing. Replay uses this same envelope helper.
Zero is also a valid caller ID; it carries no authorization meaning.
Currently the diagnostic is the stable code's own ASCII bytes encoded as
lowercase hex. Empty byte strings use `-`; nonempty hex has two lowercase
digits per byte. `hex`/`unhex` and the frame/page limits are shared with
replay, whose old public helper names remain re-exports, not duplicate codecs.
Replay also uses the bounded response-frame encoder.

## Text response

Success is `1 ID ok NEXT HEX_TEXT`. `TAB` may name an inactive tab. Missing
tabs return `missing-tab`; a changed revision returns `stale-revision`, even
if Undo restored the same bytes. Revision is checked when answering, not just
when decoding, so queue time cannot silently retarget a page.

`OFFSET` must be a UTF-8 scalar boundary in `0..=text.len()`. Otherwise the
answer is `invalid-position`. `LIMIT` is 4..=262,144 bytes; other values
return `invalid-argument`. The page ends at the last scalar boundary not
beyond `OFFSET + LIMIT` or EOF. The four-byte minimum guarantees progress
unless already at EOF. At EOF return the same offset with `-`; no extra
terminator or BOM is inserted. Bytes are normalized document text, not the
encoded on-disk representation. Paging pins every request's revision; it is
not an unbounded snapshot retained across connections.

The largest text response uses at most 524,288 hex digits plus a bounded
header/next offset, within the frame ceiling. Serialization never copies
the whole document to produce a page.

## Controller state response

Success begins `1 ID ok` followed by these tab-separated fields, in order:

1. `active=TAB_OR_0`, `keys=windows|emacs`, `prefix=0|1`.
2. One `tab=ID,REV,DIRTY,BYTES,ANCHOR,CARET,AUTO_FILL,FILL_COLUMN,BOM,ENDING`
   for each open tab in ascending ID order. Flags are `0|1`; `ENDING` is
   `lf|crlf`. Selection endpoints are directed UTF-8 byte offsets.
3. `generation=N`, `window=WIDTH,HEIGHT,SCALE`, `focus=0|1`.
4. One `view=ID,ROW,COLUMN,COLUMNS,ROWS,WRAP,AFFINITY,DESIRED_COLUMN` per tab
   in ascending ID order. `AFFINITY` is `upstream|downstream`; an absent
   desired column is `-`. View coordinates are the existing controller's
   zero-based visual row/column origin, not document byte offsets.

There are at most 64 tab/view pairs. No text bytes, file path, title, dictionary,
pending dialog/job or spelling range is serialized by this controller-only
snapshot. Its generation means local UI state, **not** a submitted buffer,
frame callback or scanout. A native endpoint must add its own state under the
full design contract before claiming complete remote control.

## Conformance

Tests pin exact request/error/text payloads, matching state/text responses
through replay, immutable controller state, maximum pages and 64-tab output,
stale-after-Undo rejection, every frame split, single-byte delivery, premature
EOF, zero/oversized/trailing frames, poisoned decoder behavior and arbitrary
byte input both as raw headers and as correctly framed payloads. Invalid
envelopes/read-only command refusals are compared with replay, separately
from the intentionally different mutation allowlists. Tests need no display,
socket, dictionary or external process.
