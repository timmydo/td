// Phase 1 of the §5 move-off-Guile goal (DESIGN §7.1 ts-frontend). These
// declarations ARE the spec language a `.ts` system spec is written against, and
// they mirror the scalar fields of the Guile `td-config` record (system
// td-typed) one-to-one — camelCase here, kebab there — because a spec lowers by
// being handed to `td-config` (the migration lowering target; the Guile/gexp
// layer stays underneath, DESIGN §5). They are deliberately AMBIENT (no
// `import`/`export`): the dialect is a curated global, mirroring the boa
// evaluator's injected globals. At author/check time `tsc` enforces these
// signatures so a malformed spec — a wrong fs type, a missing field, the wrong
// shape — is rejected BEFORE it is ever evaluated; at eval time boa provides the
// same names. Types are load-bearing here, not decoration (the `ts` rung proves
// a spec that violates them FAILS `tsc`).
